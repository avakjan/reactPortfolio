            I'm studying computer science at TalTech University. My journey in tech started out of curiosity about how software can change things, and now, I'm all about creating meaningful solutions. I enjoy problem-solving and always look for new learning opportunities. These days, I'm really into software development, with a goal to contribute to projects that make a positive impact. Thanks for stopping by!
